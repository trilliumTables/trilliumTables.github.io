                        <h2>Ginny Lengel - TurfTide Newfoundlands</h2>
                        <p>Love, love, love this grooming table top!  The gorgeous shot, taken by Klinefelter's Gallery, of a very special Newf litter of mine, always brings praise and inquires at dog shows.  Yes, it was super easy to apply; yes, it has proven to be quite durable; yes, any picture you want can be put on the table; and yes, I'll be happy to tell you where you can get one of your own.  An added bonus is that I don't have to worry about people accidentally walking off with my table!  Thank you, Klinefelter's Gallery, for offering such a special product.</p>
